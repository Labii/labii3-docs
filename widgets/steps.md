# Steps

## Overview

The steps of a protocol are critical, especially for [Electronic Lab Notebook](https://www.labii.com). The steps can be displayed in many ways in [Labii ELN & LIMS](https://www.labii.com), specifically:

* Use [Plain Text ](text.md#plain-text)or [Rich Text](text.md#rich-text) to display text format of steps.
* Use Section Citation to display the steps from a protocol.
* Use [File](file.md#overview), [Files](file.md#overview) to display the steps from an external word or pdf file.
* Last, but not least, use the **Steps** widget to track the complete status of each step.

Labii ELN & LIMS currently provides these widgets:

| Widget | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Steps | Section | Tracking status of each step. |
| Section Citation | Section | Display section data from one other record |
