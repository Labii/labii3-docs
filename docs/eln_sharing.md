# Sharing

Labii ELN supports sharing folders, documents, Experiments, Experiment-Templates and more, allowing for simplified collaboration

#Share a Document
Open the Experiment or Experiment-Template you wish to share and click on the “More” button. From the dropdown menu, click on “Share”, like pictured above. A Share Dialog Window will be displayed, looking similar to the picture below.

#Public Sharing
The “Open to public” slider indicates whether or not everyone in the Labii community can see your Experiment or Experiment-Template (we strongly encourage making well-known protocols/procedures open to the public).

##Public Folder
Once a folder is public, it is searchable by the Labii community. These folders can also be subscribed to by others, similar to a Youtube channel; see section “Subscribing for more information”.

##Public Experiment
When an Experiment has permissions set to “Public”, the document holds “View” permissions for anyone with a direct link to the Experiment (with a URL composed of appended random characters, similar to: [https://www.labii.com/notes/view/page/xIWZ0x70x67fu1dXFRTN/kerp0x70x640U3WMJANh/](https://www.labii.com/notes/view/page/xIWZ0x70x67fu1dXFRTN/kerp0x70x640U3WMJANh/) ). A public Experiment is read-only, and cannot been modified.

##Public Experiment-Template
When an Experiment-Template is has permissions set to “Public”, anyone can view the Experiment-Template with a direct link (with a URL composed of appended random characters, similar to: [https://www.labii.com/notes/view/page/VjCB0x70x67fkT96G3ya/YSz20x70x63f1qNNH25w/](https://www.labii.com/notes/view/page/VjCB0x70x67fkT96G3ya/YSz20x70x63f1qNNH25w/) ), and does not need to be logged in. A public Experiment-Template is read-only, and cannot been modified. These documents can be subscribed to, see section “Subscribing for more information”.

#Private Sharing
This window displays who currently has access to your folder, document, Experiment or Experiment-Template, and allows you to further grant/revoke access. 
To the right of each person is a slider set to “Edit” or “View”, and a trash icon. Click the “Edit”/”View” slider to grant different sharing permissions, and click the “Trash” icon to revoke access to a document or folder.


##Sharing Permissions
Each person with access to a document, including the document owner, has a permission setting of either “Edit” or “View”. The “Edit” functionality allows a collaborator to edit, and inherently view, the document. The “View” permission allows collaborators to view the document, but not make any changes. 

##Adding a Collaborator
To share a document with a collaborator, type their Labii Inc. registration email in the dialog window shown above, select permission type “Edit” or “View”, and click “Add”. An email notifying the new collaborator of their available document will be immediately sent (containing a direct link to the document)

#Share a Folder
To share a folder, simply right-click on the folder you wish to share, and select “Share”. A similar window like the one pictured below, allows you to set “Edit” or “View” permissions for collaborators.

#Nested Sharing (Sharing folders containing folders and documents)
A child folder inherits the sharing permissions of the parent folder. These permissions can be changed on an individual basis.
A document created in a shared folder, will inherit that folder’s sharing permissions. These permission can also be changed on an individual basis.

#Identifying Collaborators
Labii ELN uses several icons to distinguish how files and folders are shared.

##Folder
A public folder, document, Experiment, Experiment-Template .etc will be indicated with a Public Shared Icon appended to the name.

![labii-eln-sharing-public-readonly](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-public.png)

A privately shared folder, document, Experiment, Experiment-Template .etc will be indicated with a Private Shared Icon appended to the name.

![labii-eln-sharing-to-others-readonly](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-to-others.png)

Once a folder is clicked, the picture of each person with access to a folder will be displayed on top left.  The collaborator’s picture can be clicked to redirect you to their Labii profile.

##Documents
In list view, a publically shared document is indicated by a Public Shared Icon.

![labii-eln-sharing-public-readonly](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-public.png)

In list view, a privately shared document is indicated by a Private Shared Icon.

![labii-eln-sharing-to-others-readonly](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-to-others.png)

The pictures of collaborators with access to the document are displayed after the folder location and document name, once the document is opened.

#Shared Folders
A collection of folders shared with you is displayed in the “Shared Folders” section. Only folders that are shared with you are displayed, folders owned by you are displayed in the “My Folders” section.
