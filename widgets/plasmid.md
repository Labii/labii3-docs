## Overview

[Plasmid a genetic structure in a cell that can replicate independently of the chromosomes, typically a small circular DNA strand in the cytoplasm of a bacterium or protozoan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid) Plasmids are much used in the laboratory manipulation of genes.

Biotech scientists need to deal with plasmid almost everyday in their Electronic Lab Notebook \(ELN\) and Laboratory Information Management System \(LIMS\), [Labii ELN & LIMS](https://www.labii.com) is now providing plasmid related functions to facilitate research.

 Labii currently provide these widgets:

| Widget | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Plasmid Viewer](plasmid.md#plasmid-viewer) | Section | View map of a plasmid |
| [Plasmid Editor](plasmid.md#plasmid-editor) | Section |  |

## Plasmid Viewer

Use this widget to display the map of a \*.gb in circular or linear format. GenBank \(\*.gb\) is a plaintext format for storing DNA data as character sequences. Read [here](https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/maple/view.aspx?path=Formats%2FGenBank) for more details. 

To view the map:

1. Add the **Plasmid Viewer** Section
2. Click the "edit" icon to upload a \*.gb file. You can drag a file from your local computer or select an file that is already uploaded to Labii.
