site_description: "Labii is a professional network for academics. We provide multiple services including: 1) Academic Profiles for individual scientist to document his/her academic activities; 2) Research Groups for a group of scientists to manage and broadcast their research projects. They could be the scientists from one same laboratory, or same department; or scientists from different labs cooperating in one same project; or even student associations or a company. 3) Reference Manager to provide a post-publication review and rating platform for the scientists to select the most valuable papers to read. 4) Electronic Laboratory Notebook, for fast and accurate lab notes and reports.
