> Description = Research goals  
> Unique Code = GL  
> Icon = adjust  
> Type = Substance

### 2\) [Create the following **columns**](../settings/tables.md#customize-column) for the table **goals:**

1. **year**, The year the research goal commenced
2. **date\_start**, This shows the commencement date of the goal
3. **date\_end**, The date the goal was completed
4. **status**, shows the current status of the goal
5. **parent**, This column is used to create a bigger goal consisting of many more detailed small goals

### 3\) [Create the following **sections**](../settings/tables.md#customize-default-sections):

1. **Overview**, To give a brief description of the goal
2. **What to expect**, This is where you indicate the proposed outcome of the goal
3. **Cost estimation**, The total cost estimation that would be enough to accomplish the goal should be stated in this section.
4. **Sub Goals**, All other related goals should be stated here
5. **Jobs**, The jobs related to this goal are indicated in this section. This section can be changed to `experiments`, `protocols`, et.al.

### 4\) Add ForeignKey relationship to the goal:

You need to first add a **ForeignKey** column in the table of experiments in order to link experiment notes with goals. This is then followed by selecting a goal you created each time an experiment note is created.

### 5\) Year-end Review:

The annual review of your goals should be carried out. The review should specifically describe what has been done, what need to be improved upon and the actually cost of the goal. You must not also forget to update the status of the goal.
