#Sharing
Sharing research allows scientists to collaborate during experimentation and enhance research ability. 

#Overview
Labii ELN supports sharing folders, documents, Experiments, Experiment-Templates and more, allowing for simplified collaboration while retaining control over project and document content. 

#Permissions
Each person with access to a document, including the document owner, has a permission setting of either “Edit” or “View”. 

##Edit
The “Edit” functionality allows a collaborator to edit and inherently view the document. A document's owner retains "Edit" permissions unless the document is [locked](https://www.labii.com/docs/page/eln_lock.md/). 

##View
The “View” permission allows collaborators to view the document, but not make any changes. When a document is shared with the public, the public automatically has "view" capabilities only. 

#How to Share

##Share a Document
Open the Experiment or Experiment-Template you wish to share and click on the “More” button. From the dropdown menu, click on “Share”, like pictured below, and the Share Dialog Window will be displayed.

##Share a Folder
To share a folder, simply right-click on the folder you wish to share, and select “Share”.

##Public Sharing
The “Open to public” slider indicates whether or not everyone in the Labii community can see your Experiment or Experiment-Template (we strongly encourage making well-known protocols/procedures open to the public).

###Public Folder
Once a folder is public, it is searchable by the Labii community. These folders can also be subscribed to by others, similar to a Youtube channel; see section [“Subscribing"](https://www.labii.com/notes/support/#Subscribing) for more information.

###Public Experiment
When an Experiment has permissions set to “Public”, the document holds “View” permissions for anyone with a direct link to the Experiment (with a URL composed of appended random characters, similar to: [https://www.labii.com/notes/view/page/xIWZ0x70x67fu1dXFRTN/kerp0x70x640U3WMJANh/](https://www.labii.com/notes/view/page/xIWZ0x70x67fu1dXFRTN/kerp0x70x640U3WMJANh/) ). A public Experiment is read-only, and cannot been modified.

###Public Experiment-Template
When an Experiment-Template has permissions set to “Public”, anyone can view the Experiment-Template with a direct link (with a URL composed of appended random characters, similar to: [https://www.labii.com/notes/view/page/VjCB0x70x67fkT96G3ya/YSz20x70x63f1qNNH25w/](https://www.labii.com/notes/view/page/VjCB0x70x67fkT96G3ya/YSz20x70x63f1qNNH25w/) ), and does not need to be logged in. A public Experiment-Template is read-only, and cannot been modified. These documents can alos be subscribed to, see section [“Subscribing"](https://www.labii.com/notes/support/#Subscribing) for more information.

##Private Sharing
The [Share Dialog Window](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-dialog-box.png) displays who currently has access to your folder, document, Experiment or Experiment-Template, and allows you to further grant or revoke access to individual collaborators. 

To the right of each collaborator's name and email is a slider that can be set to “Edit” or “View”, and a trash icon. Click the “Edit”/”View” slider to grant different sharing permissions, and click the “Trash” icon to revoke access to a document or folder. 

###Private Folder
Sharing a folder to individual collaborators is very similar to sharing documents. If a collaborator is allowed "Edit" permissions, they can add and remove documents in a folder, as well as edit each individual document within that folder (unless the permissions for said document have been altered). If a collaborator is given "View" permission only, they can see the folder and document content, but not make edits. 

###Private Document
Sharing a document with a collaborator allows document owners to retain full control. Each collaborator is given "Edit" or "View" permissions. "Edit" permission lets collaborators add to, remove from, and even delete the document. "View" permissions lets collaborators see the document and its content, but not make any changes. 

##Adding a Collaborator
To share a document with a new collaborator, type their email registered with Labii Inc. into the dialog window [shown above](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-dialog-box.png), select a permission setting, and click “Add”. The new collaborator will receive an email containing a direct link to the shared document.

#Inherited Permissions
[Nested](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-nested-folders.png) folders and documents inheret permissions from their parent folder. Permissions for nested folders and documents can be changed on an individual basis.

##Nested Folder or Document
When a nested folder or document is created, it will inherit its parent folder’s sharing permissions. These permission can also be changed on an individual basis.

#Icons and Collaborator-Identification
Labii ELN uses several icons to distinguish how files and folders are shared.

##Folder
A public folder will be indicated with a Public Shared Icon appended to the name.

![labii-eln-sharing-public-readonly](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-public.png)

A privately shared folder will be indicated with a Private Shared Icon appended to the name.

![labii-eln-sharing-to-others-readonly](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-to-others.png)

Once a folder is clicked, the picture of each person with access to a folder will be displayed on top left.  The collaborator’s picture can be clicked to redirect you to their Labii profile.

![labii-eln-sharing-showing-collaborators-readonly](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-showing-collaborators.png)

##Documents
In list view, a publically shared document, Experiment, Experiment-Template .etc, is indicated by a Public Shared Icon.

![labii-eln-sharing-public-readonly](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-public.png)

In list view, a privately shared document, Experiment, Experiment-Template .etc is indicated by a Private Shared Icon.

![labii-eln-sharing-to-others-readonly](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-to-others.png)

The pictures of collaborators with access to the document are displayed after the folder location and document name, once the document is opened.

#Shared Folders
Folders that are shared with you are displayed in the “Shared Folders” section. These are folders owned by another user, folders owned by you are displayed in the “My Folders” section.

#Subscribing
Labii ELN allows you to subscribe to folders and documents, much like a Youtube channel. You will be notified via email when changes are made to folders or documents to which you are subscribed.

##Folders
To see a list of subscribable public folders, click the grid icon the right of “Shared Folders” menu.

![labii-eln-sharing-showing-public-folders-readonly](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-showing-public-folders.png)

Public folders are displayed in a grid format. You can view the contents of a public folder by clicking “View”. To subscribe to a folder, click “Subscribe”. 

![labii-eln-sharing-subscribing-to-folder-readonly](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-subscribing-to-folder.png)

##Experiment-Templates
You can also subscribe to public Experiment-Templates. Click the “Public Experiment-Templates” menu item to explore subscribable Experiment-Templates. 

![labii-eln-sharing-public-experiment-template-subscribing-readonly](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-public-experiment-template-subscribing.png)

Once you have found an Experiment-Template to subscribe to, click the “Subscribe” button appended to the document’s name. 

![labii-eln-sharing-subscribing-readonly](https://labiiblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/labii-eln-sharing-subscribing.png)

You will be notified via email when changes to the Experiment-Templates to which you are subscribed.
