# Sharing

Labii ELN supports sharing folders, documents, Experiments, Experiment-Templates and more, allowing for simplified collaboration


#Sharing Permissions
Each person with access to a document, including the document owner, has a permission setting of either “Edit” or “View”. The “Edit” functionality allows a collaborator to edit, and inherently view, the document. The “View” permission allows collaborators to view the document, but not make any changes. 

#Share a folder
To share a folder, simply right-click on the folder you wish to share, and select “Share”. A similar window like the one pictured below, allows you to set “Edit” or “View” permissions for collaborators.

#Share a document
Open the Experiment or Experiment-Template you wish to share and click on the “More” button. From the dropdown menu, click on “Share”, like pictured above. A Share Dialog Window will be displayed, looking similar to the picture below.

#Share Dialog Window

#Public Sharing
The “Open to public” slider indicates whether or not everyone in the Labii community can see your Experiment or Experiment-Template (we strongly encourage making well-known protocols/procedures open to the public).

*Public Folder
Once a folder is public, it is searchable by the Labii community. These folders can also be subscribed to by others, similar to a Youtube channel; see section “Subscribing for more information”.

*Public Experiment
When an Experiment has permissions set to “Public”, the document holds “View” permissions for anyone with a direct link to the Experiment (with a URL composed of appended random characters, similar to: https://www.labii.com/notes/view/page/xIWZ0x70x67fu1dXFRTN/kerp0x70x640U3WMJANh/). A public Experiment is read-only, and cannot been modified.

*Public Experiment-Template
When an Experiment-Template is has permissions set to “Public”, anyone can view the Experiment-Template with a direct link (with a URL composed of appended random characters, similar to: (https://www.labii.com/notes/view/page/VjCB0x70x67fkT96G3ya/YSz20x70x63f1qNNH25w/), and does not need to be logged in. A public Experiment-Template is read-only, and cannot been modified. These documents can be subscribed to, see section “Subscribing for more information”.

Private Sharing
This window displays who currently has access to your folder, document, Experiment or Experiment-Template, and allows you to further grant/revoke access. 
To the right of each person is a slider set to “Edit” or “View”, and a trash icon. Click the “Edit”/”View” slider to grant different sharing permissions, and click the “Trash” icon to revoke access to a document or folder.

Adding a Collaborator
To share a document with a collaborator, type their Labii Inc. registration email in the dialog window shown above, select permission type “Edit” or “View”, and click “Add”. An email notifying the new collaborator of their available document will be immediately sent (containing a direct link to the document)


Nested Sharing (Sharing folders containing folders and documents)
A child folder inherits the sharing permissions of the parent folder. These permissions can be changed on an individual basis.
A document created in a shared folder, will inherit that folder’s sharing permissions. These permission can also be changed on an individual basis.

Identifying Collaborators
Folder
A public folder, document, Experiment, Experiment-Template .etc will be indicated with a Public Shared Icon appended to the name 

A privately shared folder, document, Experiment, Experiment-Template .etc will be indicated with a Private Shared Icon appended to the name
Once a folder is clicked, the picture of each person with access to a folder will be displayed on top left.  The collaborator’s picture can be clicked to redirect you to their Labii profile.

Documents
In list view, a publically shared document is indicated by a Public Shared Icon

In list view, a privately shared document is indicated by a Private Shared Icon 
The picture of the shared person will be displayed on the top left once a document is opened.

Shared Folders
A collection of folders shared with you is displayed in the “Shared Folders” section. Only folders that are shared with you are displayed, folders owned by you are displayed in the “My Folders” section.




Subscribing
Folders
A folder that is shared to the public can be subscribed to, just like a Youtube channel. You will be notified when changes are made to that folder. (Via email?)

	Subscribable Folders
To see a list of subscribable public folders, click the grid icon the right of “Shared Folders” menu.
Public folders are displayed in a grid format. You can view the contents of a public colder by clicking “View”. To subscribe to a folder, click “Subscribe”. 
Once subscribed, you will be notified when changes are made to that folder.


Experiment-Templates
You can also subscribe to public Experiment-Templates. Click the “Public Experiment-Templates” menu item to to explore subscribable Experiment-Templates. 

Once you have found an Experiment-Template to subscribe to, click the “Subscribe” button appended to the document’s name. 

You will be notified of changes in your subscribed Experiment-Templates (in Feed or Email?)
Subscribed Experiment-Templates are stored in…??... for easy cloning. 

Sharing and Versions
When you share a document with a collaborator with “Edit” permissions, edits will be performed on the document that you own, not a copy. Whenever changes are made, a new version of the document is created, meaning you can easily restore to a previous version if necessary. See “Version Control” documentation for further information.
