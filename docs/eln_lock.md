To prevent a finished ELN document from accidental changes, Labii's ELN provides a Lock function to lock or unlock a document.

A locked document is a document without edit permissions. You can view, but cannot edit or delete a locked document. To enable the edit permission, you have to unlock the document.

# How to lock/unlock a document

* Click a folder -> Right-click on a document -> Lock/Unlock
* On a opened document -> More... > Lock/Unlock
