## Overview

The detail view of a record display the content of the record. This function is mostly used in Electronic Lab Notebook \(ELN\) to define the detail of a processing experiment. It can also used in the Laboratory Information Management System \(LIMS\) to record the detail of a record.

In [Labii ELN & LIMS](https://www.labii.com), the detail view is build up with a collection of sections. Each section holds certain data of the record, and use a specific widget to display and edit the content. For example, a summary section might holds the basic summary of an experiment, and the summary can be updated with a [Rich Text]() widget.
