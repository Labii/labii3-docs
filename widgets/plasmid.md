[Plasmid a genetic structure in a cell that can replicate independently of the chromosomes, typically a small circular DNA strand in the cytoplasm of a bacterium or protozoan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid) Plasmids are much used in the laboratory manipulation of genes.

Biotech scientists need to deal with plasmid almost everyday in their Electronic Lab Notebook \(ELN\) and Laboratory Information Management System \(LIMS\), [Labii ELN & LIMS](https://www.labii.com) is now providing plasmid related functions to facilitate research.

 Labii currently provide these widgets:

| Widget | Type | Description |
