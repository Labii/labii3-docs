# Comments

## Overview

Additional text messages can be added to [Labii Electronic Lab Notebook and Laboratory Information Management System](https://www.labii.com). 

Labii ELN & LIMS currently provides these widgets:

| Widget | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Comments | Section | Add comments to a record |
| GLP Comments | Section | Comments could not be changed once signed |

**Difference between Comments and GLP Comments**

The functionalities of **Comments** and **GLP Comments** are exactly the same. **GLP Comments** is different to **Comments** in that the widget meets GLP regulation. Specifically:

* Comments can be added, modified, and deleted regardless whether a record is locked or not with **Comments** widget.
* Comments will be locked from editing once a record is signed with **GLP Comments**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Be caution when using Comments widget because it is not GLP complainant. Data entered could not be used for patient application or FDA regulation. 
{% endhint %}
