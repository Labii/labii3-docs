**Create your first experiment in 4 easy steps:**

1. Click the ‘**Add**’ button on the sidebar to open the dropdown menu options. All records including ‘experiment’, ‘protocol’, ‘sample’, and more can be added simply using this menu.

Select ‘**experiment**’ to add a new experiment note in this case. You have the option to change it to other terms that are familiar to you.

**NOTE**: repetitive experiments can be tagged as ‘templates’ and recalled for later use. Click ‘submit’ to create the new experiment
{% endhint %}

3. Once submitted, a new experiment record appears with multiple potential sections. The default sections can be configured by your administrators so that they will be added automatically.

Click the \(+\) signs to insert a new section, or click the **Add** menu on top to add a section at the bottom of the record.

**Labii’s Sections work like the apps in your smartphone, each widget presents one set of functions.**

**For example:** 

Select ‘Rich text’ to edit text just like a word document. Click the edit or pencil icon to modify the data in the section, and click the Submit button to save.

Select ‘Table’ to add a new section similar to a spreadsheet table.

Labii ELN & LIMS is expandable with a list of widgets. More can be found by clicking the ‘More Widgets’ option.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**: You do not need to repeat the above steps every time. You can [configure the default sections in the Settings](settings/tables.md#customize-default-sections) and every experiment created will include those sections automatically.
{% endhint %}

4. Once a new section has been added, you can start entering the content by clicking the Edit icon.
