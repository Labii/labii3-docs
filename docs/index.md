Labii is a professional network for academics.

Traditional social networks such as Facebook focus on personal life; industrial professional networks such as Linkedin focus on job searching and posting. However, people in academia seek to advance their research through networking. This not only includes tracking peers' research work, applying for and posting jobs, but also involves discussing research and seeking collaboration. Existing social networks could not satisfy researchersâ€™ needs. We are researchers from Stanford University; we understand what researchers need. We are hence building a professional network for academics. We will charge customers for using our online apps and data.
